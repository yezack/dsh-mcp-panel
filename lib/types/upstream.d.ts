/**
 * The upstream observability seam of `@deepseek-ai/dsh-mcp-client`
 * (proposed: `mcp/status` event + `mcpStatus` query service, see
 * `packages/mcp/mcp-client/src/status.ts` in the deepseek-harness repo),
 * consumed here with feature detection, plus two PROPOSED extensions this
 * console documents in `docs/upstream-proposal.md` (deepseek-harness):
 *
 * - per-server process diagnostics (`exitCode`, `stderrTail`) on the status
 *   payload, so the health panel can quote spawn facts instead of guessing;
 * - an `mcpCatalog` service face for Resources/Prompts listings, so the
 *   console can browse them read-only the day the bridge exposes them.
 *
 * Declarations merge into `@deepseek-ai/cordis`. When upstream ships the
 * proposed fields/services, its identical declarations merge cleanly; a
 * conflicting signature fails this package's compile, which is the intended
 * tripwire. At runtime everything is feature-detected: with no upstream
 * implementation mounted, no events arrive and `ctx.mcpStatus` /
 * `ctx.mcpCatalog` are absent, so the panel falls back to derived facts and
 * reports `statusSource: 'derived'` / "pending upstream support".
 *
 * @module dsh-mcp-panel/upstream
